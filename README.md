# Splitwise
Splitwise is a tool for friends and students to track bills and other shared expenses, so that everyone gets paid back. 
Here we have implemented the core splitwise algorithm.
Given a number of friends who have to give or take some amount of money from one another. 
We have designed an algorithm by which the total cash flow among all the friends is minimized.
