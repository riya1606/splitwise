# Splitwise
## Project Overview:
Splitwise is a versatile tool designed to simplify expense tracking and reimbursement among friends and students. In this project, we have implemented the core Splitwise algorithm to address the complex task of managing financial transactions within a group. With a focus on efficiency and fairness, our C++-based algorithm ensures that the total cash flow among all friends is minimized, simplifying the process of settling debts and expenses.
